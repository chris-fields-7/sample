Cyclistic Case Study:
   This was my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (completed November 7, 2022).  The objective of the project was to take twelve months of data from a bike share company and determine the key differences between annual members and casual riders.  These insights would be delivered to stakeholders in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.  The combined dataset contains 5,828,235 observations of 13 variables, which describe every bike ride taken between October 2021 and September 2022.  I employed the R programming language to complete the data analysis, Tableau to create the data visualizations, and PowerPoint to compile the final presentation.
   
   The data for this project was generated by Divvy, a bicycle sharing service owned by the City of Chicago, operated by Lyft Bikes & Scooters, LLC.  It has been provided for the public use by Motivate International Incorporated.
