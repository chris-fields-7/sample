Cyclistic Case Study:
   This was my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (completed on November 7, 2022).  The objective of the project was to take twelve months of data from a bike share company and determine the key differences between annual members and casual riders.  These insights would be delivered to stakeholders in the form of a PowerPoint presentation.  
   
   The data for this project was generated by Divvy, a bicycle sharing service owned by the City of Chicago and operated by Lyft Bikes & Scooters, LLC.  The data has been provided for public use by Motivate International Incorporated.
